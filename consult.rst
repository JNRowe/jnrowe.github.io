:description: Guidelines for consulting services

From time to time I’m asked to consult on various projects, and I tend to find
myself in very similar conversations at the start of such a relationship.
Hopefully, the guidelines on this page will help me and potential clients save
some time.

-----

Firstly, there are some things I’m not interested in:

* Evaluating projects for investors or investment groups.
* Broad discussions with steering committees or design groups.

I’m primarily interested in solving clearly detailed, specific technical
problems.  If you’re still at the discussion stage on a project or you’re an
early stage startup with non-technical founders, then I’m likely not the guy
you’re looking for!

That said, here are the guidelines:

#. I can *not* sign contracts that are expected to require more than 21
   *consecutive* workdays to complete.
#. I will *not* sign contracts that attempt to impose restrictions on who I may
   work with or the topics that I can work on.
#. I will *not* sign contracts unless they are applied according to
   UK or an EU member state’s laws, with disputes resolved in the
   jurisdiction’s court.
#. The first 15 minutes are free, all additional time will be chargeable and
   invoiced. [#]_
#. I will *not* sign any |NDA|, unless they are time limited. [#]_

Some of these rules can be side-stepped, if you can meet one of the following
criteria:

* You’re a non-profit organisation
* Your for-profit company has an existing partnership with my current employer

.. [#] I may be willing to offer extra free services for non-profit
       organisations
.. [#] Any |NDA| with a limit in excess of three years is likely to be
       a insurmountable barrier.

.. |NDA| replace:: :abbr:`NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreements)`
