Ugh, why no comments???
=======================

Many moons ago, when my blog was hosted elsewhere I built a comment system for
it.  Comments came in, I learnt things, I was corrected when wrong.  Times were
good.

However, my own personal version of `eternal september`_ occurred at some point
and the comments became almost valueless(spam or unrelated rants).  I disabled
them; times were good again.

Then back in 2009, I re-added comments via Disqus.  There was almost no spam,
and the comments felt mostly useful.  Disqus remained for a little while, but
I never felt comfortable with it.  It forces an `enormous amount of tracking`_
on visitors, and does so regardless of whether an actual comment is being
posted.  I disabled it; times were good again again.

But, I want to comment!!!
-------------------------

Cool, I like comments.  I’ve learned a lot of things via comments about this
site and its previous incarnations.  I absolutely welcome them, but I don’t
want to wade through spam or enable enormous amounts of tracking on visitors.

If you want to comment then drop me a mail_, reply via `your own site`_ or as
a last resort `open an issue`_.

If your comment is more of a clarification or a fix, you may even want to
consider a pull request.  If my friend Matt can `do it`_, so can you!
