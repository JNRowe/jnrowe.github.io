Murdering morality with ferocious fire
======================================

.. epigraph::

    "Morality is herd instinct in the individual."

    -- Friedrich Nietzsche

When I look back at my life's work thus far I often find myself asking the
question "was it worth it?"

That question isn't meant in some kind of crazed suicidal manner, I just mean
specifically the projects I've worked on and the things I do.  Are they just?
Should I be doing this?

I truly hope it doesn't come as a surprise to people who know me, but I consider
myself to be a person of strong moral values [#s1]_.  I probably shouldn't admit
this publicly, but over the years I have turned down several projects I didn't
feel ethically comfortable working on.  And it has *demonstrably* held my career
progression back.  I mostly fine with that.  No, I really am.

The simple fact is that I'm due for a HR review, overdue actually, and these
questions have started to come to the fore again.  I'll lay in bed thinking
about them, I'll sit here typing about them, I'll judge other people to gauge
the validity of my position and I'll bore people who'll listen with my
dilemmas.

One shouldn't really use the word "dilemma" here, these issues are practically
the definition of "First World Problems".  Part of me is disgusted to waste so
much time on frankly trivial introspection, but for better or worse it is
a *huge* part of my self-identity.

I feel that -- to some extent -- I'm living a weak, self-imposed and
inconsequential version of `Pascal's Gambit`_.  I know full well that the works
I've rejected have been seen to completion by others.  I've not scuppered them,
nor have I even attempted to.  Not having me work on them has perhaps even made
them far more effective at whatever aspect I took exception to.  I'm making
moral decisions with no weight beyond my own mind, no ripple beyond my own
insignificant life puddle and no wake beyond this now excessively long essay.

However, in the face of these realisations I still find myself unable to
consider the decisions wrong.  I'd still choose to reject them now, and
I suspect that will remain true in the future.  I like that these decisions are
defensible to *me*, that they *must* be defensible to me.  I love that the thing
that keeps me awake at night is not the thought of the possibly nefarious
effects of my works, but rather the exceedingly minor issue of not having
a glistening and well-spec’d M6 in the garage.

Now, let me sleep.

.. [#s1] For those values to be strong doesn't necessarily mean they have to
   line up with your definition of "strong moral values" ;)
