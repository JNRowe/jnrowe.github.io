Side-projects
=============

Chatting with my brother yesterday he expressed some disbelief when I mentioned
*yet another* friend who has a website related to some topic we were discussing:

   Does everyone you know run a website?

Yes, yes, they do.

It hadn’t really occurred to me until I was reading a write up of a co-workers
weekend hack.  The majority of nerdy people I know run websites, create
iPhone/android apps or have other side projects in various states of completion.
It’s just How Things Work®

I guess it is mostly a cultural issue, one which is quite strong behind the
engineering side of the curtain in my workplace.  Sure, there are some “5:01”
types who are out of the door as soon as the bell rings, but there are an awful
lot who extend their tech creations in to a downtime hobby or side business.

..
   For better or worse very few of the 5:01’ers tend to become my friends.  It
   isn’t because of a deep seated hatred for them, it is simply because we’re
   not active in the same circles.  They’re not talking about their hacks,
   documenting them or commenting on the odd things others are making.  And to
   be quite truthful they aren’t likely to be working in the same teams as
   people I’d normally call friends from work.  The type of work I do tends to
   attract those who’d prefer to grind on an obscure problem long after the
   lights have been switched off.

To relate this to my brother I think of a family party we attended this past
weekend.  When people asked me what my brother does I’d say that he works in
logistics, and the conversation drifts from there.  When talking to the
extended family that often seemed to head toward being about material
possessions that work may afford him.  However, I’ve noticed in the past when
I’m talking to people I’d call friends it often quickly digresses in to strange
discussions about box packing, routing, `the curse of travelling salesmen`_ or
`bridges in some foreign land`_.  Because of the math and technology
implications many of my friends have written tools to explore some of the
practical and theoretical issues faced in logistics… often for fun.

It is all about me
------------------

I’m not working on any public facing websites right now [#s1]_, but I do play
with a few public facing projects from time to time that should head towards
proving my point.  I’m picking a few semi-randomly to illustrate a little
diversity.

.. note::

   To save myself some researching effort I’ll only link to things from `my
   GitHub profile`_ or links from my browser’s bookmarks, but that should be
   descriptive enough to get the point across.

Gentoo packages
'''''''''''''''

Over the past decade I’ve spent a lot of time hacking on things related to
Gentoo_.  Some of that for work projects and some of it for `personal
projects`_.  I’ve also experienced my fair share of troubles, and have `reported
a few bugs`_.

At one time I even hoped to `become a developer`_, but that didn’t work out for
a bunch of reasons.

``github2``
'''''''''''

For a year I maintained_ a relatively popular `API wrapper`_ to GitHub.  I did
this because I found it fun.  It provided no economic benefit to me, and I never
expected it to.  I know a lot of people used it when building their own toy
projects and websites, because many were kind enough to link to it.

``pyisbn``
''''''''''

For seven years I’ve maintained a small library for `validating ISBNs`_.
*Yes, that is absolutely as boring as it sounds*.

It was never meant to be used by others, I just needed something to validate
entries in my e-book database.  Other people started using it, many for their
own weird side projects including a number of book retail websites.  It has
amassed literally tens of thousands of downloads from |PyPI|, but you really
shouldn’t trust the dubious statistics from |PyPI| ;)

``rdial``
'''''''''

``rdial`` is a `time tracking tool`_, and a perfect example for me.  I played
with it for over a year before anyone else saw it, just because it scratched an
itch I had.  I never imagined it would be useful to others.  Turns out it was,
and there is now a small yet faithful band of users.

I even received the great honour of a few summer evening beers for releasing it.
A beer being second only to a patch in the table of project endorsements
that I subscribe to.

``upoints`` née ``earth_distance``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

upoints_ is a strange one.  It started as a `stupid hack`_ to figure out some
silly travel planning drama, it proceeded to take on a life of its own.  Over
the years it attracted a fair amount of users, and I still receive email about
it now.

It did have some tangible benefit though, the sadly now defunct website it
eventually spawned opened some nice doors for me.  I didn’t know it would or
could at the time, so it didn’t affect how I spent my time when playing with it.

Cut from the pattern
--------------------

This isn’t specific to me, or even to the particularly nerdy among my
co-workers.  If you `dig around on GitHub`_, or even makezine_, you’ll see
people creating purely because they can.  This isn’t a new phenomenon either.
If you were around pre-GitHub you’d see people making things on Sourceforge.  If
you were around before Sourceforge, you’ll remember the good old days when life
was simpler and people held doors open for you.

.. _dig around on GitHub: https://github.com/explore
.. _makezine: http://makezine.com/

The point is simple.  Yes, I *may* know someone who is working on
project/website related to some topic, but that is only because many of the
people I know are spitting out new projects on what often appears to be a weekly
basis.
