&lt;p&gt;A few co-workers have started offering office hours, seemingly spurred on by
a post by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/22/slash-office-hours/"&gt;Robert Heaton&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m going to try this a little closer to Robert’s
original idea, and make &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; offer to strangers too&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to chat, I want to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Appointment icon [from Adwaita icons]" class="align-left" src="../../_images/appointment-new.png" /&gt;
&lt;section id="what-topics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What topics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You choose, that is the point.  That said, here are some thoughts…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My career thus far has mainly been focused on navigation systems, both
&lt;abbr title="Global Navigation Satellite System"&gt;GNSS&lt;/abbr&gt; and land-based; if you’re
interested in chatting about that &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re heading for your first clearance interview, and want to practise with
someone who has both passed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; failed get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have many connections in industry and are just looking for general
advice, then by all means get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just need a little &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt; time, let us make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, get in touch and we’ll see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-do-you-need-to-know"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you need to know?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that if this works out I’ll likely write my own &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/02/lessons-from-my-first-20-office-hours/"&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt;, so
don’t expect total privacy.  I’m also a fan of &lt;span class="xref std std-doc"&gt;writing tips&lt;/span&gt;, so I might take any questions and run with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie to you, I do plan on having a quick poke around before
agreeing to a call.  If you’re socially or professionally poisonous to me,
I &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; make time for you.  It sounds harsh, but I want to be upfront about
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often have a rough schedule, but I’ll try to make time.  Even though I’m UK
based, my schedule pins me to other timezones on occasion and I may be able to
accommodate you even if you’re far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a native English speaker, confident social German speaker, muddling
Castilian speaker, and I’m told by my French co-workers that I’m fluent in
French docker… so you will need to be able to communicate in one of those or
wish to &lt;em&gt;teach me&lt;/em&gt; another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="how"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to make this happen is to drop me a &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:jnrowe&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;gmail&amp;#46;com"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;.  If the idea gets
any traction I’ll look at better ways of scheduling, but until then mail should
be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="updates-2019-01-15"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates - 2019-01-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve just completed my second appointment, and it seems to be working out
okay.  Both have been fun(at least for me), and I’m planning on continuing this
experiment for a little while longer.  Do get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also passed on two “applicants” who I felt would be better served by other
people, and that seems like a very valuable feature to add to the idea.
I passed both of them on to co-workers, and I could only do this easily because
I knew they were playing around with the idea of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;/office-hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  It would
be nice if there was a register that made it is easier to link poor matches
with better matches.  Obviously it needs to be weighted in some way, “show me
&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;$connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;office-hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;$tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;” for example, but it
might be a nice idea for a weekend hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="rubric"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="footnote brackets"&gt;
&lt;dt class="label" id="id2"&gt;&lt;span class="brackets"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the norm for my co-workers is to make this offer on our
semi-private mastodon instance, but I’d like to think I was implicitly
offering help there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
