Visualising the progress of time
================================

A co-worker was demoing a user session today, and pointed out a neat tool for
MacOS that displays the “continual march toward death”.  That tool was
`Progress Bar OSX`_, and it is pretty cool.  Sadly it is only available for
MacOS, so we’ll need to make something similar.

   Click the image for an animated GIF, I’ll spare you the flashing lights in
   case you wish to read on.

Step one
--------

First we’ll want to display the year:

.. code-block:: sh

   gdbar -w 1500 -h 20 \
      <<< $(($(date +%j) / $(date -d'Dec 31' +%j).0 * 100)) \
      | dzen2 -p 5

which results in:

.. image:: /.images/day_bar.png
   :alt: Screenshot of simple day of year bar on 2018-11-13

The logic should be simple enough to follow(if you’re familiar with
:command:`date`’s :option:`%j formatter <date %j>`):

* ``current day in year`` / ``number of days in year`` [#]_ * ``100`` for
  position in year as percentage
* Generate the :command:`dzen2` markup for a bar of ``1500`` pixels wide and
  ``20`` pixels high
* Display it for ``5`` seconds

.. warning::

   Be sure to notice that we force ``number of days in year`` to be a float
   with the addition of ``.0``.  Without it the result would be rounded toward
   zero, ie zero on every day but December 31st.

We can repeat the same process for day ratio; using ``date -d "00:00" +%s`` to
calculate number of seconds passed from the 86400 we’ll see today.  And then
simply using ``date +%m`` to get today’s month as a number.

Step two
--------

We can definitely up our game here.  Why not use colours?  We’ll switch to
Python_ now, as the gigantic standard library allows us to be lazy.

::

    def pcnt_colour(percent):
        h = 1/3 - (1/3 * percent/100)
        return '#' + ''.join(f'{min(int(n*256), 255):02x}'
                             for n in colorsys.hls_to_rgb(h, .5, 1))

The function above converts a percentage value in to a hex triplet across
a green to red gradient, we use :func:`~colorsys.hls_to_rgb` here as the `HLS
colour space`_ is more amenable to generating smooth gradients.

Now that we’re using Python_ we may as well take advantage of its
:mod:`calendar` module::

    def month_days(date):
        return calendar.monthrange(date.year, date.month)[1]

The :func:`~calendar.monthrange` function returns a tuple where the second item
is the number of days in the current month.

::

    def days_in_year(date):
        if calendar.isleap(date.year):
            days = 366
        else:
            days = 365
        return days

:func:`~calendar.isleap` allows us to offload figuring out whether 2700 is
a leap year once senility begins to set in.

::

    def show_progress(title, percent, width):
        subprocess.run(['gdbar', '-l', title, '-w', str(width), '-fg',
                        pcnt_colour(percent)],
                       input=str(percent).encode())

We’ll also create a utility function to generate the :command:`dzen2` markup
required to output our little blocks of data.

Putting it altogether we can display our pretty little blocks with something
like the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./time_progress.py -w 1500 \
        | dzen2 -l 3 -p 3 -fn monospace-15 -e 'onstart=uncollapse'

This creates the markup and makes :command:`dzen2` display the output for
3 seconds.

.. image:: /.images/progress_bar.png
   :alt: Screenshot of colourful progress in time

The ``onstart=uncollapse`` attribute tell :command:`dzen2` that we want to see
the full output on startup, without it we’d see just the title bar until we
moved our pointer over the header.

Step four
---------

You can find the script I used :download:`here <time_progress.py>`.  It isn’t
pretty, but it will do.  If I come to depend on it I’m sure that I’ll make
something better.

I think it is important to note that if you’ve got this far and you’re thinking
about doing this yourself you should consider buying the `Progress Bar OSX`_
app.  This document wouldn’t exist without it and rewarding creators is
important, even when they ignore your chosen platform ;)

Step ∞
------

As always with any code that touches dates `“Here be dragons”`_.  For example,
I’ll leave it as an exercise for the reader how to handle calculations for days
with :abbr:`DST (Daylight Saving Time)` transitions.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Calculating the day of year for December 31st allows one to work in leap
       years.

.. program:: date

.. option:: %j

    Displays the day number of the given year, see :manpage:`strftime(3)` if
    this is new to you.
