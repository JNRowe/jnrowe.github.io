Office hours
============

A few co-workers have started offering office hours, seemingly spurred on by
a post by `Robert Heaton`_.  I’m going to try this a little closer to Robert’s
original idea, and make *this* offer to strangers too [#]_.

If you want to chat, I want to help.

What topics?
------------

You choose, that is the point.  That said, here are some thoughts…

My career thus far has mainly been focused on navigation systems, both
:abbr:`GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)` and land-based; if you’re
interested in chatting about that *absolutely* get in touch.

If you’re heading for your first clearance interview, and want to practise with
someone who has both passed *and* failed get in touch.

If you don’t have many connections in industry and are just looking for general
advice, then by all means get in touch.

You just need a little `rubber duck`_ time, let us make it happen!

Basically, get in touch and we’ll see what happens!

What do you need to know?
-------------------------

Be aware that if this works out I’ll likely write my own retrospective_, so
don’t expect total privacy.  I’m also a fan of :doc:`writing tips
<articles/tips/index>`, so I might take any questions and run with them!

I’m not going to lie to you, I do plan on having a quick poke around before
agreeing to a call.  If you’re socially or professionally poisonous to me,
I *won’t* make time for you.  It sounds harsh, but I want to be upfront about
that.

I often have a rough schedule, but I’ll try to make time.  Even though I’m UK
based, my schedule pins me to other timezones on occasion and I may be able to
accommodate you even if you’re far away.

I am a native English speaker, confident social German speaker, muddling
Castilian speaker, and I’m told by my French co-workers that I’m fluent in
French docker… so you will need to be able to communicate in one of those or
wish to *teach me* another.

How?
----

The easiest way to make this happen is to drop me a mail_.  If the idea gets
any traction I’ll look at better ways of scheduling, but until then mail should
be fine.

Updates - 2019-01-15
--------------------

So, I’ve just completed my second appointment, and it seems to be working out
okay.  Both have been fun(at least for me), and I’m planning on continuing this
experiment for a little while longer.  Do get in touch!

I’ve also passed on two “applicants” who I felt would be better served by other
people, and that seems like a very valuable feature to add to the idea.
I passed both of them on to co-workers, and I could only do this easily because
I knew they were playing around with the idea of ``/office-hours``.  It would
be nice if there was a register that made it is easier to link poor matches
with better matches.  Obviously it needs to be weighted in some way, “show me
``$connections`` using ``office-hours`` with ``$tag``\” for example, but it
might be a nice idea for a weekend hack.

.. [#] It seems that the norm for my co-workers is to make this offer on our
       semi-private mastodon instance, but I’d like to think I was implicitly
       offering help there anyway.
